  <p>Biography: <br>
      My name is Kulsoom Karakoc and I am a former English teacher who is new to the web development world. I have 16 years’ experience teaching English literature and language to high schoolers in Texas and abroad. I received my BA from the University of Texas in 2004 and my MA from the School of International Training in 2011. I’m currently enrolled in a coding certification course with MIT. We have learned the basics of Javascript, HTML, and CSS, and I’ve managed to create a few animations, which you’ll see in my projects page. I’m eager and excited to fully immerse myself into the coding world and hope to bring my unique set of soft skills and my newfound coding knowledge to your company. </p>
