    <p>
        I am a former English teacher who is new to the tech industry. Having taught English literature and language to high school students in Texas, Qatar, Turkey (and then Texas, again!), I do not shy away from adaptation. When life changed in March 2020, I took time, like many others, to think about what I hadn't yet done and reflect on what I had. 
     </p>

     <p>
        I studied, with vigor, the works of Plato and Neoplatonists, Pythagoras, as well as some abstract mathematical concepts. This burst of intellectual growth gave me a sense of passion and purpose I had somehow forgotten as a teacher teaching the same content for over a decade. 
     </p> 

    <p>
        In April 2021, I enrolled in a coding certification course with MIT. In June 2021, after much contemplation, I resigned from an amazing teaching job at a renowned performing arts high school and decided to fully pursue coding. Why coding and not philosophy? Having taught hybrid for the whole year and still somehow managing to connect with students, I realized there is great potential to collaborate and create in the non-physical realm. I wanted to know the inner workings of what we ALL lived and breathed--the web--and got excited at the variation of jobs in coding out there. 
     </p>

        I am a mom of two beautiful children, but I adore the fulfillment of working hard with like-minded peers affords me.
