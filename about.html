    <p>
        I am a former English teacher who is new to the tech industry. Having taught English literature and language to high school students in Texas, Qatar, Turkey (and then Texas, again!), I do not shy away from adaptation. When life changed in March 2020, I reflected, as all of us did, on what I had and had not yet done in my life. 
     </p>

     <p>
        I studied, with vigor, the works of Plato and Neoplatonists, Pythagoras, and esoterics. I studied the numbers one and zero--in great depth--and learned about the variations of infinity. And I stumbled upon coding, something I had always been curious about but never even came close to understanding. These bursts of intellectual growth gave me a sense of passion and purpose I had somehow forgotten as a teacher teaching the same content for over a decade and a half. 
     </p> 

    <p>
        In April 2021, I enrolled in a coding certification course with MIT. Two months later, I resigned from an amazing teaching job at a renowned performing arts high school and decided to fully pursue coding. Having successfully taught hybrid the whole year, I realized there is great potential to collaborate and create on the internet. I wanted to know the inner workings of what we ALL live and breathe: the web. 
     </p>

    <p>
        I am a dedicated mom of two beautiful children, but I adore the fulfillment working hard with like-minded peers affords me.
